## Description

I built this project as a way to keep code snippets safe when I need to. Have you ever needed to stach your code in order to fix a merge conflict? I certainly have. While you might simply stash that code, it is always valuable to have another way to back up your work just in case. That is what JATE offers. Through this project I learned about progressive web applications (PWAs). I learned about the steps to set up webpacks, and accessing the indexed database.
